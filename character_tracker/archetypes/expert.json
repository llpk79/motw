On a miss, you can ask a question anyway but that will mean you were personally complicit in creating the situation you are now dealing with. The questions are:\nWhen I dealt with this creature (or one of its kind),what did I learn?\nWhat black magic do I know that could help here?\nDo I know anyone who might be behind this?\nWho do I know who can help us right now?",
